### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

I'm passionate about programming language design â€” especially creating clear, expressive syntax and transforming code using ANTLR4 and Python.

### ðŸ”§ What I do:
- Design and implement custom grammars using **ANTLR4**
- Working on a transpiler that converts my own experimental language into C#
- Explore **code analysis and transformation**
- Automate tasks with **AutoHotkey**, **VBA**, and scripting
- Work with legacy languages such as **VB6**

### ðŸ’¡ Interests:
- Programming language theory & design
- Code parsing and transformation
- Static analysis tools
- Modernizing legacy systems
